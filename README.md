# Process of data collection through eye tracking
It can be done in two phases. 
Calibration Phase: The technology(CNN -2D) obtains information about the size, curvature, and position of the eye. Initial calibration must occur before data collection to match the angle of reflected light on the stimulus screen. 
# Quantifying the data recorded in Eye Tracking : 
To quantify the stream of data recorsing the x-y coordinates of the user. That way , each image is divided into 'regions' and 'area of interest' using a trajectory drawing program in the software. 
Eye movement is the real-time input medium for humancomputer communication, which is very important for people with physical disability. 
We shall be using eye tracking primarily for mouse controlling. Our goal is to achieve basic mouse activity and traversal just by using eye movements. It includes, Scrolling, Cursor Traversal and Clicking (Left and right).
